# [VIZ.cx](https://viz.cx/)

VIZ is a Graphene-family blockchain with a Fair-DPOS consensus algorithm (vote weight splitted to selected witnesses, witness gets a penalty for missing a block). This site is just yet another entrypoint to show posts inside blockchain that posted via [Voice protocol](https://github.com/VIZ-Blockchain/Free-Speech-Project/blob/master/specification.md).

## Frontend

Frontend is created on top of [Nuxt.js framework](https://nuxt.com) and [Vuetify.js](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) and [viz-js-lib](https://github.com/VIZ-Blockchain/viz-js-lib) to interact with VIZ blockchain on client-side.

## Backend

Backend is created on top of [FastAPI Python framework](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) and uses [viz-python-lib](https://github.com/VIZ-Blockchain/viz-python-lib) to obtain data from VIZ blockchain on backend-side.
